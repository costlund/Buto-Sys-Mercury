  description: |
    Mercury is a Buto system software. 
    It runs on any server supporting PHP. 
    It has no dependencies like any type of database. 
    The main configuration of a Buto system is done with yml files.
    Only 22 files with .php extension for the hole framework.
    HTML code is done with yml in the exact same way but with the benefit to add extra Buto system params.
    One could work with Buto without any knowledge of PHP when building a theme. Only in plugin development PHP skills are needed.

          name: Roles
          description: |
            Roles visitor, unknown and client are handled by the system.
            - visitor (always)
            - unknown (if user NOT signed in)
            - client (if user signed in)
            
            Roles normaly used by theme builders.
            - webmaster (user has full access)
            - webadmin (application administrator)
            - developer (user is in developer team)
            
            Along with this roles plugin can handle custom roles depending on purpose. For example.
            - invoice (user should handle invoices)
            - moderator (user is a moderator)

            In folder sys/mercury/git there are sh files to run git status/pull/fetch for all repos. Navigate in terminal to this folder and run commands.
            ```
            sh git_status.sh
            sh git_fetch.sh
            sh git_pull.sh
            ```
            Sometimes when clone a git repo files get status changes. One could solve this issue by running this command.
            ```
            sh git_fileMode.sh
            ```
