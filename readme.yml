    Mercury is a Buto system software. 
    It runs on any server supporting PHP. 
    It has no dependencies like any type of database. 
    The main configuration of a Buto system is done with yml files.
    Only 22 files with .php extension for the hole framework.
    HTML code is done with yml in the exact same way but with the benefit to add extra Buto system params.
